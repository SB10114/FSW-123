There is  one main rule  (Links to an external site.) you have to follow when using Hooks and it has to do with where Hooks can be called.

Only call Hooks from the top-level of a function component

Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions or nested functions.
You can only call them from inside a functional component.
The hook definitions must be defined at the very top of the component.
That also means you canâ€™t call them from a normal function or a class component.
