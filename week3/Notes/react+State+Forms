As we learned previously, in a controlled form, you let React fully "control" the element by setting and updating the input value directly. A controlled form is what you will normally use in creating forms in component. A component that contains a controlled form is called a controlled component.

Reviewing the code below, the following is true:

The handleNameChange() event is called every time that any change is present in the name input field
event.target.value references the current contents of the input field.
The value attribute of the input field is tied to the name and email state variables.
The values of the name and email state variables are conditionally rendered underneath the form.
As changes are made to the name and email input field, the onChange event is fired and causes the event handler functions to update the state variables.

When the form is submitted, the submission event is captured and the handleSubmit handler is invoked and just clears the input field values. 

Having a controlled form inside a component, makes that component a controlled component (Links to an external site.).

You can build complex forms that makes use of checkboxes, radio buttons, and other input types with functionality for validation, data processing, and much more.

As your form increases in complexity, developers eventually use form component libraries such as react-hook-form (Links to an external site.), formik (Links to an external site.), react-final-form (Links to an external site.), etc.
